## Overview

In the TAC shopping game, each "agent" (an entrant to the competition) is a travel agent, with the goal of assembling travel packages (from TACtown to Tampa, during a notional 5-day period). Each agent is acting on behalf of eight clients, who express their preferences for various aspects of the trip. The objective of the travel agent is to maximize the total satisfaction of its clients (the sum of the client utilities).

Travel packages consist of the following:

- A round-trip flight,
- A hotel reservation, and
- Tickets to some of the following entertainment events
  - Alligator wrestling
  - Amusement park
  - Museum
